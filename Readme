# This repository contains code for analyzing median income and wealth comparison based on race and education levels.
## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare the median income and wealth of different racial and educational groups. The analysis includes calculating the median housing wealth, median debt related to housing, median non-housing wealth, and median income for each group, using weighted medians for accurate results.




## Results
The analysis will generate a DataFrame with the following columns for each race and education level:

'race_education': The race and education level combination.
'median_housing_wealth': The median housing wealth value.
'median_debt_housing': The median debt related to housing value.
'median_non_housing_wealth': The median non-housing wealth value.
'median_income': The median income value.
The 'median_income' column will be represented as a heatmap with colors ranging from cool to warm tones.
